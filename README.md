Hi everyone! I'm @KtheVeg

I'm a student developing software/games as a hobby. I'm an active user of JS and C#, and can write in many other programming languages

My goal is to make something helpful to be used by others. If you ever find my open-source software useful, drop a donation on my ko-fi page

Anyway, have a good day
