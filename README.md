Hi everyone! I'm @Veggieoskibroski

I'm a student developing software/code as a hobby. I've coded in Lua, JS, and Bash/Shell Script

I'm never running dry of ideas on what to code. If anyone wants to work with me on anything, let me know.
You can contact me via Discord (Veggieoskibroski#5570).  


Anyway, have a great day!
