Hi everyone! I'm @KtheVeg

I'm a student developing software/games as a hobby. I'm an active user of JS and C#, and can write in many other programming languages

I enjoy writing code to help others make better code. My goal is to make something helpful to be used by others

Anyway, have a good day
